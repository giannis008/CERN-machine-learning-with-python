# Machine Learning with Python

*Getting started with scikit-learn*


Following on from the *Introduction to Machine Learning* course, this series of hands-on workshops will get you started with applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods in Python, using the popular `scikit-learn` package.

## Intended Learning Outcomes

After completing this workshop, you will be better able to:

* Prepare a dataset for machine learning in Python
* Select a scikit-learn method appropriate for a particular learning task
* Construct your own workflows for model training and testing
* Evaluate the performance of a model

## Setup

We will be working with python using jupyter notebooks. The easiest way to access jupyter is via the Anaconda platform.

Please install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com in advance of the first session.

Please ensure that you have an up-to-date scikit-learn package installed prior to starting the first session.
General installation instructions are available here:
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html#installation-instructions

scikit-learn is part of the default installation of Anaconda, so you may already have everything you need.


## Getting Started

Download this repository to your computer as a ZIP file and unpack it.

Open JupyterLab (within Anaconda) and navigate to the unpacked directory to work with the .ipynb notebooks.

Alternatively, you can run the notebooks online using Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/johnpinney/machine_learning_with_python/main?urlpath=lab)



## Data sets

We will be working with a variety of real and synthetic data sets to illustrate various methods.
For your own work between classes, you will be asked to identify a suitable data set from your own research or from other work within your field.

You can start thinking about this before the course, but the main requirements for a machine learning data set will be discussed more during the first session.
